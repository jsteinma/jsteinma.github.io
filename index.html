<h4>Bio</h4>

<p>I am currently a student at The North Pole training to be 
one of Santa's helpers. I have gotten a lot of experience 
with gathering the right tools to make the sturdiest toy,
and collecting the correct colours of paint to show the best
balance and contrast that is most appealing to the human eye.</p>
<p>I am continuously improving my teamwork skill, as my current
training has me constantly working with others as well as 
singing songs with everyone as we work.</p>
